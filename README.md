Burp Intruder File Payload Generator
========
This extension provides a way to use file contents as custom Intruder payloads.

Suppose you need to test a file upload request with your library of carefully crafed files, such as gifar, php files, jpeg, jpegs with embedded php, stuff with wrong magic numbers, etc. You can paste those binaries contents on the Repeater one by one but that is boring.
Instead you can use the Intruder configured to the payloads generated by this extension. The extension just needs to be pointed to the file payloads folder.

Usage
------
* load the extension: a new PayloadTab should appear
* at the PayloadTab, choose the payload folder
 * the extensions reads all files recursively
 * it also lists all of them if you need to sync the file contents with the file name in the Intruder request (use Pitchfork)
* disable the "URL-encode these characters" option, at Intruder -> Payloads -> Payload Encoding


TODO
------
* exclude files like .DS_Store
* button to disable the "URL-encode these characters" option
* verify file read permissions upon folder selection
