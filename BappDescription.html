<p>This extension provides a way to use file contents and filenames as Intruder payloads.</p>
<p>Usage:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Load the extension. A new tab called PayloadTab should appear.</li>
    <li>In the PayloadTab, choose the payload folder. The extension reads all 
	files recursively and lists them.</li>
    <li>In the payloads tab of the Intruder tool:
        <ul>
            <li>At Payload Sets -&gt; Payload Type, select Extension-generated.</li>
            <li>At Payload Options, select File as Payload or Filename as 
			Payload.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you just need to use the file contents as payload, select File as Payload.</li>
                    <li>If you need both the content and filename then choose Pitchfork as the Attack type and use File as Payload for one Payload set and Filename as Payload for the other.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>At Payloads -&gt; Payload Encoding, disable the &quot;URL-encode these 
			characters&quot; option (specially for multipart POST requests).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Requires Java version 7.</p>
